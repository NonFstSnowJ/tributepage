    <h2>History So Far..</h2>
        <p>This is everything so far that happened for Inter Miami. They were founded in 2018 while their first game was in 2019 with the academy team while in March 1, 2020. Inter Miami had their first MLS game against Los Angeles FC, but lost 1-0. The good thing is that they got their first win in their new stadium against Orlando City SC 3-2 in 2020. After a few months Inter Miami want to grow more so they brought in a Superstar named Higuain for 2 years scoring 29 goals and 14 assists retiring at Inter Miami. This definitely helped the club, but after his retirement they started to lose more games. Now there is a chance for Inter Miami to be the best club in the MLS. In July 15, 2023 Inter Miami signed Superstar Lionel Messi soon after his former teammates joined him Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba now things are looking brighter than before i wonder what will Inter Miami will accomplish in the future. </p>
